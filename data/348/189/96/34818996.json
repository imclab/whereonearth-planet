          "The Kepler-20 system hosts at least five transiting exo-planets. Kepler-20 e is most likely a rocky planet made of iron and silicates. It has approximately the size of Venus and is the first discovery of a sub-Earth size planet by the Kepler team. It is not habitable because the planet is on an orbit very close to its host star and the equilibrium temperature is as high as 1000 Kelvin (726C, 1340F). ",
