          "KOI-254 b was originally discovered by the Kepler spacecraft. It has now been confirmed to be a planet by radial velocity measurements, adaptive optics imaging and spectroscopy. The host star is an M-type dwarf star, just over half the size of our own sun. KOI-254 b is the first hot Jupiter that has been found around such a low mass star.",
