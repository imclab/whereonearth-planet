"The Universe is full of null islands." â€“ [Michal Migurski](http://mike.teczno.com/)

The short version
--

Where On Earth (WOE) data for planets smushed up the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](http://exoplanet.hanno-rein.de/) of
planetary bodies.

New WOE IDs have been minted using one of three artisanal integer providers:
[Mission Integers](http://www.missionintegers.com/), [Brooklyn
Integers](http://www.brooklynintegers.com/) or [London
Integers](http://www.londonintegers.com/).

The longer version

_I still need to write it._

A word about Github
--

In the long-run Github may not be the best venue for managing all of these
records. But it's not an entirely crazy idea either so we're going to try it for
a while because it's easy and safe.

To do
--

* Figure out how calculate geometries and/or an interplanetary spatial
  referencing system for these records. [I could use some help with this.[(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_ellipsoid#Ellipsoids_for_other_planetary_bodies)
