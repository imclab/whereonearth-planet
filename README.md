"The universe is full of null islands" â€“ [Michal Migurski](http://mike.teczno.com/)

The short version
--

Where On Earth (WOE) data for planets smushed up the [Open Exoplanet Catalogue](http://exoplanet.hanno-rein.de/) of
planetary bodies.

The longer version
--

_I still need to write it._

A word about Github
--

In the long-run Github may not be the best venue for managing all of these
records. But it's not an entirely crazy idea either so we're going to try it for
a while because it's easy and safe.

To do
--

* Figure out how calculate geometries and/or an interplanetary spatial
  referencing system for these records. I could use some help with this.
